Tortoise and the hare algorithm

moves two pointers at different speeds through the sequence of values until they both point to equal values.


ListIterator Implementation
current position hovers between the elements (no previous or next)


JavDocs
An iterator for lists that allows the programmer to traverse the list in either direction, modify the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator's current position in the list. A ListIterator has no current element; its cursor position always lies between the element that would be returned by a call to previous() and the element that would be returned by a call to next(). An iterator for a list of length n has n+1 possible cursor positions, as illustrated by the carets (^) below:
                      Element(0)   Element(1)   Element(2)   ... Element(n-1)
 cursor positions:  ^            ^            ^            ^                  ^
